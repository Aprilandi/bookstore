## Steps to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository
   - Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Aprilandi/bookstore.git
   cd {directory}/bookstore
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   - Install PHP dependencies:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. Environment setup
   - Copy .env.example to .env and adjust your database configuration:
   ```
   # Unix / macOS
   mv .env.example .env

   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

   Note: Set the DB connection you want to use:
   - For MySQL (recommended in this project): set `DB_CONNECTION=mysql` and update `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` to match your local MySQL server. Make sure MySQL is running and the `pdo_mysql` PHP extension is enabled.
   - For a quick local setup using SQLite: create the file `database/database.sqlite` and set `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite` in your `.env`.

4. Generate application key
   - Generate the Laravel application key:
   ```
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Run database migrations and seeders
   - Create tables and run seeders:
   ```
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

   Note: If you already have dummy data in a database with the correct tables and columns, you can skip this step. If you need to seed but want it to finish faster, reduce the number of records generated by factories (for example, lower counts in (BookSeeder, AuthorSeeder, BookCategorySeeder, and BookRatingSeeder)) so the seeding process runs quicker.

6. Start the development server
   - Run the application locally:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```
